= Dave's MultiTimer

image::multitimer.jpg[hardware multi-timer]

A multiple-category project/productivity timer with pretty RGB-lit
MX-compatible keyboard keyswitches and backlit LCD output. Running a
ridiculously powerful (yet inexpensive) dual-core ARM processor.

== Work in progress!

This is not a functioning timer _yet_. But I believe I've finally cleared the
last of the hurdles and the basic timer functionality is just another weekend
away. :-)

Also coming soon: Some sort of enclosure. Probably wood because that's what I
have the tools to work with.

== What's it made of?

Hardware:

* Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller (RP2040 32-bit dual ARM Cortex-M0+)
* Adafruit NeoKey 1x4 QT I2C Breakout (Cherry-compatible keypad + NeoPixels)
* SparkFun SerLCD (RGB 16x2 LCD + AVR microcontroller with I2C, etc.)

Runtime/VM:
